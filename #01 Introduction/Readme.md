# Introduction To React

- A javaScript library for building user interfaces.

## User Interface (UI)

- The user interface (UI) is the point of human-computer interaction and communication in a device.This can include display screens, keyboards, a mouse and the appearance of a desktop.

## Is React Library or Framework?

- React is not a framework. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- React knows only one thing that iss to create an awesome UI.

## History of React 

- Designed by Jordan Walk, a software engineer in facebook.
- It was first deployed for Facebook News feed around 2011.
- In 2023, React was open sourced at JS conference.

- ### Open Source 
- an open source project is where the code to a certain project is completely open source.
- That means that anybody can readily see the code that went into a project.
- Open source projects also are usually community-based, and accept help from other programmers.

## About React

###  1- Component Based approach.

- A component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. Components make the task of building UIs much easier.

###  2- Uses a Declarative Approach

- Declarative programming is a programming paradigm... that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

- Declarative programming is like asking your friend to draw a landscape. You don't care how they draw it, that's up to them.

###  3- DOM updates are handled gracefully
###  4- Reusable Code
###  5-  React is designed for speed, speed in implementing the application simplicity and scalability.

## Why React

- Created and maintained by Facebook.
- It has a huge community on GitHub.
- Component Based Architecture.
