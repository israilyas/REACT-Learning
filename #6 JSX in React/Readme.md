# JSX in React

- JSX => Javascript extension/Javascript XML

JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML, is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It allows you to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript, which makes it easy to build user interfaces, especially in frameworks like React. With JSX, you can write something that looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript under the hood.
